## This is a collection of ideas I have to implement on my code:

- [x] Include different pathfinding algorithms:
    - [x] A* search
    - [x] ABC artificial Bee Colony
    - [x] ACO ant colony optimization

### Ideas from advanced programming concepts
- [ ] Implement a map function for the wind drift when the drones fly
- [ ] Maybe I can use the map function to get access to the locations of the goals
- [ ] Can use reduce to calculate the total energy or cost created by the agents
- [ ] Ideas: use the filter function to filter the goals which are active and not active

- [x] Travis call beginning of April:
    - [x] Gewicht emissions tracker

- [x] Adding dynamic fire spread mechanics
- [ ] Implementing drone coordination/communication
- [ ] Creating more sophisticated firefighting strategies
- [ ] Adding weather/wind conditions that affect fire behavior and drone movement
- [ ] Optimizing station placement based on simulation results

- [x] Including emission of the fire and emissions prevented estimates


- [ ] run the search algorithms comparison 1000 times and compare with confidence intervalse
    - [ ]  run a parameters search to find the best parameters for each approach
- [ ] run the plane drone hybrid comparison 1000 times.

- [ ] implement machine learning in the strategy
- [ ] do a parameter optimization for the bee colony
- [ ] clustering ares based on firelocations as higher risk areas using ML
- [ ] maybe for the video when explaining the thesis its useful to explain it with flowdiagrams
